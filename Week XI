I did not sign any petitions online this week because I honestly do not give a shit about anything right this instance. And though I have been removed and distant from this class as time progresses, I do want to thank you for your time and teaching this class. I have learned aa good many things but most importantly, I have learned that tech is not a field for me. So thank you for saving m time and money.
