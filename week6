I still don't have the best understanding of how databases work or where they are used in an everyday capacity, but it would seem like the most effective way to reduce duplication is to have the system recognize repeat values and alert the user of there existence. It would be best if the program also showed where the duplication is located so the user can determine if a duplication is necessary or not.
